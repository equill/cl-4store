4store is an efficient, scalable, and stable RDF database.  
For more information, see their website: http://4store.org/

The code contained of this repository was originally provided by Patrick D. Logan
as a collection of 'workspace' code for exploring a 4store RDF knowledgebase
using Common Lisp. His original project can be found on Github:
https://github.com/patrickdlogan/sbcl-4store

mon-key spent a bit of effort to write a proper system definition in order to make
sbcl-4store loadable from Quicklisp. In the process we've also significantly
altered the original sources, all changes retain the original BSD license see
the file COPYING in this same repository.

I'm now turning it into a library on which other libraries can be built, on top
of which all sorts of applications can be written. This involves yet more significant changes.

Note, although the system name is prefixed by "sbcl-" there is currently nothing
limiting use of this system with implementatons other than SBCL...

Using sbcl-4store will require a working installation of 4store. It also assumes that you've compiled it with the '--enable-dedup-insert' argument to 'configure'

sbcl-4store has dependencies on the following Quicklisp-installable systems:
 drakma
